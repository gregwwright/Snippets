      <p>Our own-root roses are first year cuttings grown and shipped in special pots, 6" deep by 3" wide, designed for tree seedlings. The pot allows a strong root system to develop and the rose will not experience the transplant shock bare-root roses do. The rose itself is about 8 - 10" above the soil line of the pot. The own-root roses you will receive are smaller than budded roses and grow very rapidly.    </p>

    <h1>Heirloom Roses</h1>
    <p>We are proud of our special hybrid variations on classic beauties. We are particularly proud of the following roses. Download a brochure with more information about <a href="roses.pdf">Our Full Line of Heritage Roses</a>.</p>
     <h2><img src="images/rose-1.jpg"  alt="" width="201" height="162" class="floatRight"/>Apricot Beauty</h2>
      <p>We offer a great climbing rose that is an addition to our "Impressionist" line of fragrant climbing roses. This continual blooming climbing rose has all the charm and grace of an old garden rose. </p>
      <p>Rich, deep apricot bronze buds unfurl into lovely, many petaled 4-5" blooms of a beautiful shade of apricot. May be grown as a large shrub or climber. </p>

      <h2><img src="images/rose-2.jpg"  alt="" width="201" height="151" class="floatRight"/>Moonlight</h2>
      <p>Light pink buds open to pale pink blooms with a light fragrance on a rounded plant with dark green leaves.</p>
      <p>This plant is a continual blooming upright bush with reddish stems and bronze-green foliage which provides a background for the striking blooms and an added bonus of lovely fragrance.</p>

      <h2><img src="images/rose-3.jpg"  alt="" width="201" height="160" class="floatRight"/>Clementino</h2>
      <p>Rated by the American Rose Society ahead of 29 out of 32 David Austin English Roses for exhibition beauty. This rose has been greatly admired by both our staff and garden visitors, receiving rave reviews. </p>
      <p>Bred from 'Grady Thorn'. The old-fashioned, fully double, English-style 4" blooms (petals 70) can best be described as an intense copper. It is a color quite unlike that found in any other rose. When John first saw the rare beauty and outstanding character of this rose he knew he would name it for his wife. </p>
      <p>This plant is a continual blooming upright bush with reddish stems and bronze-green foliage which provides a background for the striking blooms and an added bonus of lovely fragrance.</p>
